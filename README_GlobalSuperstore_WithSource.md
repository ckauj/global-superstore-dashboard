# ðŸ“Š Global Superstore Analytics Dashboard

**Role:** Data Analyst  
**Tools:** SQL Â· Power BI Â· DAX

---

## ðŸ§© Project Overview

This project showcases the full data analytics lifecycle â€” from raw data ingestion and cleaning in SQL to dynamic, insight-driven reporting in Power BI.

Using the *Global Superstore* dataset, I designed a database, applied cleaning techniques, and built a dashboard focused on sales performance, profitability, and customer behavior.

## ðŸ”§ Key Steps

### 1. Data Engineering (SQL)
- Designed a relational schema with foreign keys to normalize raw data into fact and dimension tables.
- Loaded data into MySQL using CSV.
- Cleaned and transformed the raw CSV using SQL scripts:
  - Checked for duplicates using `ROW_NUMBER()`
  - Cleaned inconsistent encodings and formatted dates
  - Converted postal code from float to string

### 2. Data Modeling (Power BI)
- Created measures and calculated columns for:
  - Profit Margin
  - Repeat Customer Percentage

### 3. Data Visualization
- Designed a responsive Power BI dashboard including:
  - KPI cards (Sales, Profit, Orders, Profit Margin)
  - Conditional formatting for Profit Margin
  - Trend analysis with slicers for Market and Year
  - Interactive customer-level detail

## ðŸ“ˆ KPIs Tracked

- **Total Sales and Profit**
- **Profit Margin by Market**
- **Repeat Customer Rate** (~99.4%)
- **Top Markets by Revenue**
- **Sales and Profit Trend Over Time**
